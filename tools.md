### Simple Assessment 
**Assessment Tool for Scoring Evidence of Demonstrating CC2020 Dispositions**
[Excel Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rNIv5rAfHXQl2sO5LjERphkocqzAh1Y94vAeAeDUE8s/edit?usp=sharing)
This simple tools suppoprts  instructors in evaluating a student's 
demonstration of the CC2020 dispositions. The tool applies the expectation 
for competence set out in ISO 24773: to apply knowledge and skills [...] 
successful[ly] [...] on an ongoing basis. This implies that each 
disposition must be demonstrated in multiple activities over the duration of the student's course.

The tool is based on counting items of evidence that demonstrate particular dispositions.  It follows that there needs to be some record of such items of evidence - whether an expolict portfolio, a lab notebook, a professional development logbook or whatever, which can be iin any reasonable format, either electronic or paper-based.  The portfolio can cover a defined period ranging from an individual module to the entire program.

Each item of evidence (portfolio item) should be validated - that is, based on evidence, or corroborated, or confirmed by a supervisor or teacher, and should also be identifiable,  by date, entry number, page number, a url or similar.

The tool then performs an overall evaluation by counting the number of portfolio item references entered against each disposition.    

The outcome is "Pass" if the (configurable) thresholds have been met, otherwise "not pass yet" if the student still needs to develop some of the dispositions.

The thresholds are derived from the values set for the configuration parameters, which are defined on the next sheet.

#### Usage Notes
The configuration, input and output areas are denoted by shading:
* configuration
* input: *references to the portfolio items*
* output: *thresholds, scores, and outcomes

Non-input cells are locked.

Users who wish to reconfigure this tool for a different number of dispositions should contact the authors for a partially-unlocked version.
