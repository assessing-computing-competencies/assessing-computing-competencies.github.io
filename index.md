Building on the IT2017 contributions, the ACM/IEEE Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020) report enriches the disposition concept by identifying eleven dispositions, such as being adaptable or self-directed, that all computing programs should include in the career preparation of their graduates. While the importance of dispositions is widely appreciated by both academic programs and employers, how to develop and assess dispositions in a degree pro- gram remains a challenge. 

The assessment tools made available through this site help educators assess 
studentsâ€™ achievement of CC2020 dispositions through the SFIA 
responsibility characteristics. Our proposed assessment method and tool are 
based on portoflio evidence of performance of tasks in real-world work 
settings, demonstrating SFIA responsibility characteristics.
